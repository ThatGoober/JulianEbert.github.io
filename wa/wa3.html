            The Chrysler PT Cruiser is a compact car that was built by the American company Chrysler from 2001 until 2010. <br> 
            Introduced as a five-door hatchback wagon,[3] a two-door convertible variant was also made from 2005 until 2008. <br>
            Originally planned as a Plymouth model, the PT Cruiser was ultimately marketed as a Chrysler when Plymouth was discontinued. <br>
            [4] Intended to invoke 1930s aesthetics, the exterior of the PT Cruiser was designed by Bryan Nesbitt.[5] The model <br>
            received an intermediate facelift for the 2006 model year. Interior packaging was noted for its high roof, high h-point seating,<br>
            and flexible cargo and passenger configurations enabled by a multi-level rear cargo shelf and rear seats a user could fold, tumble, or remove. <br>
            The PT Cruiser was produced in Mexico and Austria at the Toluca Car Assembly and Eurostar Automobilwerk factories. <br>
            By the end of production in July 2010,[6] worldwide production had reached 1.35 million.[7] <br>
            In its nameplate, PT stands for "Personal Transport[8]" or "Personal Transportation".[9] PT was the PT Cruiser's <br>
            product code for the Mexican-made units.

                    The PT Cruiser was part of the nostalgia wave that included models such as the Volkswagen New Beetle and the Mini Cooper. <br>
                    Rather than recalling previous namesake models, the PT Cruiser recalled the 1930s and 1940s styling,[20] influenced by the <br>
                    Chrysler Airflow.[21] <br>

                    The 2000 PT Cruiser grew out of a collaboration with Robert A. Lutz, who was an executive at Chrysler at the time, Dr. <br>
                    Clotaire Rapaille, and Bryan Nesbitt.[22] Nesbitt later went on to design the Chevrolet HHR. The PT Cruiser's design was <br> 
                    loosely inspired by the Chrysler Pronto Cruizer concept car while recalling the Chrysler and Desoto Airflow. Aspects of <br>
                    the PT Cruiser's rear styling also resembled the Chrysler CCV, a retro-styled compact vehicle recalling the Citroen 2CV, <br> 
                    while its high roof evoked the Chevrolet Advance Design trucks.[23] On launch, the PT Cruiser was described as a market <br> 
                    segment-buster. Chrysler's Dieter Zetsche characterized it as a continuing example of the automaker's innovation for new <br> 
                    segments, demonstrating "you can have head-turning style, practicality, and value all in one package."[24] <br>
                    Car and Driver described the design as "highly distinctive, appeals to a broad segment of the public, and is <br>
                    characteristically American."[17] The public's reaction to the PT Cruiser was polarized, but inspired a solid following <br> 
                    among owners.[20] Overall, the car "was a valuable vehicle for many consumers." <br>

                    he PT Cruiser is a front-wheel drive 5-passenger vehicle, classified as a truck in the US by the NHTSA for CAFE fuel <br>
                    economy calculations but as a car by most other metrics. Chrysler specifically designed the PT Cruiser to fit the NHTSA <br>
                    criteria for a light truck to bring the average fuel efficiency of the company's truck fleet into compliance with CAFE <br>
                    standards.[11] A turbocharged GT model was introduced for the 2003 model year. A convertible was introduced for the 2005 <br> 
                    model year. <br>

                    The cars were manufactured at Toluca Car Assembly in Toluca, Mexico. On March 8, 2006, DaimlerChrysler announced that <br>
                    1,000,000 PT Cruisers had been built.[12] The final PT Cruiser was built on July 9, 2010. A total of 1,050,281 PT Cruisers <br>
                    were marketed in the United States. <br>
                    <br>
                    The PT Cruiser was also assembled at the Eurostar Automobilwerk in Graz, Austria, for markets outside North America, <br> 
                    using the production code PG, for the model year 2002. European PT Cruisers built in 2001 or from 2003 on were manufactured <br>
                    in Mexico under the PT production code. The US version used a 2.4 L four-cylinder gasoline engine. In addition to this <br> 
                    standard model, a 2.2 L four-cylinder diesel engine built by Mercedes-Benz was also available in Europe, Asia, and South Africa. <br>
                    A 2.0 L engine (D4RE) was also available outside the US. It produced 140 hp (104 kW) SAE at 6500 rpm with 130 lb⋅ft (176 N⋅m) <br> 
                    of torque at 4800 rpm. <br>

                    In July 2000, the PT Cruiser replaced the Neon in Japan as their small car offering. Chrysler sold over 10,000 PT Cruisers in Japan. <br> 
                    The five-door hatchback, two-door convertible, and GT turbo engine package were sold in Japan in right-hand drive configurations. <br> 
                    Japanese versions were manufactured at the Austrian factory and were equipped similarly to European specifications. From 2002 until 2007, <br>
                    the PT Cruiser was used in the city of Urayasu, Chiba Prefecture by the Maihama Resort Cab company to serve as a taxi in the vicinity <br> 
                    of Tokyo Disneyland because of its fun, retro appearance. The PT Cruiser taxis augmented the Maihama Resort Line service to Tokyo <br>
                    Disneyland. The ten Chrysler PT Cruisers were to help customers "hold on to that lingering Disney feeling all the way home."[13] <br>
                    The cars were offered in Japan until April 2010, when it was replaced by the Dodge Caliber.[citation needed] <br>

                    2005 PT Cruiser used by New South Wales Police in Australia as a community public relations vehicle <br>
                    The PT Cruiser arrived in Australia in mid-2000 and came in only three specification levels: Grand Tourer, Limited, and Touring. <br> 
                    Until 2006, the only choice of engine was the 2.0 L. The cabrio was introduced to Australia in 2006.[14] From 2006, all models, <br> 
                    including the new cabrio, received the 2.4 L I4 engine coupled to a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual. Sales were never <br> 
                    spectacular, and the car's reputation for lackluster performance turned buyers to the competition. Sales sharply declined following <br>
                    the facelift despite the newer models having a more powerful engine. Between 2000 and 2009, total sales for Australia were 7,000.[15] <br>
                    <br>
                    In 2001 Motor Trend named the PT Cruiser as its Car of the Year and Car and Driver put it on its Ten Best list. the PT Cruiser <br>
                    also won the North American Car of the Year.[16][17] The PT Cruiser also won the North American Car of the Year, based on a solid <br> 
                    majority of top automotive journalists charged with "picking a vehicle that has set new standards or benchmarks in its class while <br> 
                    considering aspects such as general design, safety, fuel economy, handling, general roadworthiness, performance, functionality, <br>
                    technical innovation, driver satisfaction and price."[18] It also held the distinction of being listed by Consumer Guide automotive <br>
                    editors as "Best Buy" continuously from 2001 through 2006.[19] <br>

                    PT Cruiser models included the Classic edition, Limited edition, Touring edition, Couture edition (2010 only), "Dream Cruiser," <br>
                    "Street Cruiser," "Pacific Coast Highway" edition," and PT Cruiser GT. The non-GT Turbo (180 hp (134 kW)) edition models (introduced in 2004) <br>
                    were identified by a "2.4L Turbo" badge on the lower right-hand corner of the rear lift-gate. The GT model (introduced in 2003) has a "2.4L <br> 
                    Turbo High Output" badge on the right-hand corner of the lift-gate indicating the 215 230 hp engine version. <br>
                    <br>
                    Updates for 2006 included scalloped headlights, a revised grille no longer extending below the "bumper," a new lower front fascia that <br>
                    eliminated the patented brake cooling ducts, redesigned taillights, and available round fog lamps. The changes reduced the "retro vibe" <br> 
                    that did not satisfy some customers and " exposed the main pitfall of retro design: How do you update old?"[20] <br>
                    <br>
                    Interior updates included a revised interior with an updated dash with an analog clock in the center stack. The audio system featured a <br>
                    line-in jack for MP3 players integrated into the dash. Features such as satellite radio, a premium sound system by Boston Acoustics with <br>
                    external amplifier and subwoofer, and UConnect hands-free Bluetooth for compatible cell phones also became available in 2006. The standard <br> 
                    audio system now included an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player and a 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack with six speakers, <br> 
                    replacing a cassette player and four speakers. The turbocharged 2.4 L I4 was available in 180 hp (134 kW) or "High-Output" 230 hp (172 kW) <br>
                    versions. A "Mopar" cruise control unit became available as an aftermarket unit on 2007 models. Also, in 2007, Chrysler dealers were permitted <br>
                    to order vehicles with separate options (unbundled options from option packages) such as anti-lock brakes and Side Impact Airbags. Sirius <br> 
                    Satellite Radio also became an option that could be installed as a dealer option with a factory appearance (i.e., roof mount satellite antenna). <br>

                    Original plans called for the PT Cruiser to receive a complete redesign for 2007, but that was pushed back. Little was changed as Chrysler was <br> 
                    sorting out powertrains, styling, and even positioning as a luxury compact SUV.[19] The convertible and the High Output engine were discontinued <br> 
                    for the 2008 model year and sales dropped as information spread that Chrysler was going to discontinue the PT Cruiser shortly.[19] <br>
                    <br>
                    For 2010, the last year of production, one trim level, the PT Cruiser Classic, was offered. It included a 2.4 L I4 engine producing 150 hp <br> 
                    (112 kW), standard four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive, AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player, auxiliary audio input jack and <br> 
                    six speakers, rear-mounted spoiler, air conditioning, cruise control, tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS), front and rear side SRS airbags, <br> 
                    keyless entry with two remotes and panic alarm, ABS anti-lock brakes, and sixteen-inch alloy wheels. Optional features included leather seating <br>
                    surfaces, a power front driver's bucket seat, an engine block heater, a power tilt-and-sliding sunroof, and heated dual front bucket seats. Exterior <br> 
                    color options were Bright Silver Metallic, Brilliant Black Crystal Pearl Coat, Deep Water Blue Pearl Coat, Inferno Red Crystal Tinted Pearl Coat, <br>
                    Silver Steel Metallic, and Stone White Clear Coat. The only interior color option was Pastel Slate Gray. <br>
